export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I'm a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati. My journey in technology is driven by a passion for leveraging cutting-edge tools to tackle real-world challenges and enhance user experiences. Iâ€™m currently working on my skills in full-stack development, working with HTML/CSS and React.js on the front-end, and Node, Express, and SQL on the backend.  My academic coursework and personal projects have provided me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I have also gained valuable experience with various software development tools and technologies.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy lifting weights, exploring the latest advancements in technology, and spending quality time with friends. I thrive in collaborative environments and take great satisfaction in solving complex problems through teamwork and innovation.

I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and to contribute my skills to impactful projects and initiatives.`;
